Changes since version 0-1.0

	* robust inference is provided with meat and estfunc methods
	defined for mlogit models.

	* alt.subset argument is added to mlogit so that the model may be
	estimated on a subset of alternatives.

	* reflevel argument is added to mlogit which defines the base
	alternative.

	* hmftest implements the Hausman McFadden test for the IIA
	hypothesis.

	* mlogit.data function has been rewriten. It now use the reshape function.

	* logitform class is provided to describe a logit model: update,
	model.matrix and model.frame methods are available.

	* the estimation is now possible on "unbalanced" data, ie when the
	choice set is not the same for every individual

	* much improved interface for the mlogit function: model.frame and
	model.matrix methods have been added for logitform objects
